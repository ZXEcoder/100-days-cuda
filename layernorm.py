"""
In this lesson on LayerNorm we'll finally connect our kernels to PyTorch's backpropogation graph. Keep in mind
this kernel is fast but it only works for normalizing vectors that fit within SRAM, so we've done a trade-off
of better speed for worse generalize-abililty

What you'll learn:
- Writing a backward pass kernel
- re-using intermediate values from a forward pass in the backward pass
- Using torch.nn.functional to connect to PyTorch's backpropogation graph
- Locks and atomic operations
- How to use sequential kernels with intermediate tensors to complete a calculation 
    more efficiently than one kernel alone could

Recommended order to read the code in:
Step 1 - unit test
Step 2 - wrapper
Step 3 - forward pass kernel
Step 4 - backward pass kernels
Step 5 - benchmark

    """
    Now we'd like to take our single contributions to dLdw and dLdb and somehow aggregate them with
    the portions that all of the other PIDs have calculated.
    The reason this aggregation has to happen is because the input x is of shape (M, N) while
    the weights and biases are of shape (N), meaning they receive gradients from all M rows of x,
    and this PID holds the gradient of one of those rows, but it's not easy to communicate
    that information between PIDs.
    The specific operation to do between all these rows is to sum them up, but we can't just
    naively tl.load(), then add our row, then tl.store() because all of the PIDs would do so
    at slightly different and completely unpredictable times, meaning all the tl.store() calls
    would overwrite each other.
    What we need first a way to ensure that only one PID at a time does the read, flop, and 
    write while all the other PIDs others wait their turn.
    For this we can use what's called a lock, which is a way for us to ensure that only one 
    PID can work on a given part of a tensor in DRAM at a time, AKA "locking" it.

    However, even that's not great because if only one PID can do work at a time and we have a 
    lot of PIDs, then that's a whole lot of time leaving a large majority of the GPU sitting 
    idle while they wait in line. 
    What we need then is a way for GROUPS of PIDs to work sequentially with a lock while each
    group works in parallel to the others. 
    This is why we created dLdw_intermediate and dLdb_intermediate, each of which has shape 
    (GROUP_SIZE, N).
    We're going to assign every PID to a group, and then use our locking mechanism to ensure
    that only (M // GROUP_SIZE) PIDs attempt to wait around for their turn to work on a row
    of dLdw_intermediate and dLdb_intermediate at a time.
    In this way we've now gone from a sequential process with M steps to one with 
    (M // GROUP_SIZE) steps. 
    Then in the next kernel we'll take these (GROUP_SIZE, N) matrices and reduce them further
    down to the desired shape (N) matrices of dLdw and dLdb.

    But how do locks actually work?
    In this case we've got a tensor of shape (2 * GROUP_SIZE) and datatype int32 that's
    initialized to all zeroes. 
    The first GROUP_SIZE entries are for holding an indicator of the state of that lock;
    0 means unlocked and 1 means locked for the row of dLdw_intermediate and dLdb_intermediate 
    that it corresponds to.
    The latter GROUP_SIZE entries are for holding an indicator of whether this lock has
    ever been used before, which is useful because we'll want to run different code if
    this PID happens to be the first one to add its values to dLdw_intermediate and dLdb_intermediate.
    To use the lock, we check if the entry corresponding to the group that our PID is
    in is locked or unlocked:
    - if it's locked, then we wait and check again in a moment until it's unlocked
    - if it's unlocked then we'll lock it, load the current value of our group's row of 
        dLdw_intermediate and dLdb_intermediate, add our dLdw_contribution and dLdb_contribution 
        respectively, write those new values back to DRAM, and finally unlock it
